First,
u will see two txt file. One called as django_tutorial is to tell how to establish basic environment of django, and the other one named as aniable_to_heroku_note is to instruct how to upload your achievement,django files, onto the heroku.

Second,
Folder named as bb102finals is my special project,elephant in the room, with teammates in Institute for Information Industry. Our project's purpose is to offer a transparent market for rent, so we integrate positive and negative information, inclusive open data from government, in the circumstance where users select their own dorable suites.
bb102finals is the file composed of django, so it's required basic knowledge of running django by command line.

Third,
folders,venv and venvFinal, are success examples of uploading onto the heroku platform. Therefore, u can practice how to prepare setting based on them.
It would be suggested to use the folder, boardhero, to practice how to upload file on to heroku because it is consistent with the aniable_to_heroku_note. In addition, there is a tutorial file showing how to use the website.
My project's website: https:elephantbb102.herokuapp.com/home/  , and it would work only when I run my server on heroku.
